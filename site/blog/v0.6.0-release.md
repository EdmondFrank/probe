# Probe v0.6.0: Enhanced AI Integration and Code Editing Capabilities

We're excited to announce the release of **Probe v0.6.0**, a major update that significantly enhances AI integration capabilities and introduces powerful new features for AI coding assistants. This release represents months of development focused on making Probe the most comprehensive tool for AI-powered code understanding and manipulation.

## üöÄ What's New in v0.6.0

### Revolutionary Implement Tool

The headline feature of v0.6.0 is the new **[implement tool](/cli-mode#code-editing---allow-edit)**, which enables AI assistants to directly edit code files during conversations. This breakthrough capability transforms Probe from a read-only code search tool into a full-featured AI coding companion.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Direct Code Editing**: AI assistants can now modify files directly through Probe
- **Aider Integration**: Leverages the powerful Aider tool for sophisticated code modifications
- **Safe Execution**: Configurable via `allow_edit` flag with proper permission controls - see [GitHub Actions configuration](/integrations/github-actions#code-modification-options)
- **Context-Aware**: Combines code search with intelligent editing suggestions

```javascript
// Example: AI can now implement features directly
const result = await implementTool({
  instruction: "Add error handling to the login function",
  files: ["src/auth.js"],
  context: searchResults
});
```

### Enhanced GitHub Actions Integration

v0.6.0 introduces several powerful GitHub Actions enhancements that make Probe even more valuable for team workflows:

#### Allow Suggestions Feature
- **Reviewdog Integration**: New `allow_suggestions` flag enables AI-powered code suggestions - see [GitHub Actions Integration](/integrations/github-actions#suggested-changes-allow_suggestions-true---recommended)
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Automatic code review suggestions on PRs
- **Configurable Workflows**: Fine-grained control over when suggestions are enabled

#### Failure Tagging and Monitoring
- **Automatic Tagging**: Failed Probe runs are automatically tagged for easy tracking
- **Better Debugging**: Enhanced error reporting and logging
- **Workflow Reliability**: Improved stability across different repository configurations

#### New Specialized Workflows
- **probe-engineer.yml**: Dedicated workflow for engineering-focused AI assistance - see [AI Engineer example](/integrations/github-actions#example-2-ai-engineer-code-editing-enabled)
- **Enhanced probe.yml**: Improved main workflow with better error handling
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for GitHub Actions

### Crates.io Publishing

Probe is now available as a **Rust library** on crates.io, opening up new integration possibilities:

```toml
[dependencies]
probe = "0.6.0"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Native Rust Integration**: Use Probe directly in Rust applications
- **Library API**: Clean, documented API for programmatic access
- **Automated Publishing**: Seamless releases synchronized with GitHub

### AI Chat and MCP Improvements

#### Enhanced Chat Experience
- **Configurable Iterations**: Control AI conversation length with `MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS` - see [AI Chat configuration](/ai-chat#configuration)
- **Better Tool Support**: New file listing and search capabilities
- **Improved Session Management**: Enhanced token tracking and conversation history

#### MCP Protocol Updates
- **Mandatory Path Parameters**: Improved tool definitions with required parameters - see [MCP Server tools](/mcp-server#available-tools)
- **Better Error Handling**: More informative error messages and validation
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Consistent tool behavior across all MCP implementations - see [MCP Integration guide](/mcp-integration)

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Windows Support**: Significant improvements for Windows users
- **Binary Management**: Enhanced download and path resolution
- **Permission Handling**: Fixed binary permission issues across platforms

### Developer Experience
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for new features
- **Better Examples**: Real-world use cases and implementation patterns
- **Improved Testing**: Expanded test coverage and CI/CD improvements

### Performance and Reliability
- **Search Optimizations**: Faster code search with improved ranking
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory usage for large codebases
- **Error Recovery**: Better handling of edge cases and error conditions

## üìà Impact on AI Coding Workflows

v0.6.0 represents a paradigm shift in how AI assistants interact with codebases:

### Before v0.6.0: Read-Only Analysis
```
AI: "I can see the bug in line 42, but you'll need to fix it manually"
```

### After v0.6.0: Full Code Interaction
```
AI: "I found the bug in line 42. Let me fix it for you..."
[Automatically implements the fix]
AI: "Fixed! The error handling now properly catches network timeouts."
```

### Real-World Use Cases

#### Automated Code Reviews
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-review.yml
- uses: buger/probe@v0.6.0
  with:
    allow_suggestions: true
    prompt: "code-review"
```

#### Interactive Development
```bash
# Start an AI coding session
npx @buger/probe-chat@latest --allow-edit
```

#### Custom AI Tools
```rust
// Integrate Probe into your Rust application
use probe::{search, extract, implement};

let results = search("authentication logic").await?;
let code = extract(&results[0]).await?;
implement("add rate limiting", &code).await?;
```

## üõ† Migration Guide

### For GitHub Actions Users
Update your workflows to take advantage of new features:

```yaml
# Old configuration
- uses: buger/probe@v0.5.0

# New configuration with v0.6.0 features
- uses: buger/probe@v0.6.0
  with:
    allow_edit: true          # Enable code editing
    allow_suggestions: true   # Enable PR suggestions
    prompt: "architect"       # Use specialized prompts
```

### For API Users
The core API remains backward compatible, with new optional parameters:

```javascript
// Enhanced search with editing capabilities
const probe = new Probe({
  allowEdit: true,  // New in v0.6.0
  maxIterations: 50 // Configurable iterations
});
```

### For Rust Developers
Add Probe as a dependency to access the new library API:

```toml
[dependencies]
probe = "0.6.0"
```

## üîÆ Looking Ahead

v0.6.0 lays the foundation for even more exciting developments:

- **Advanced AI Agents**: Multi-step reasoning and planning capabilities
- **IDE Integrations**: Native support for popular code editors
